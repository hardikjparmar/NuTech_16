						<h3>3D Printing</h3>
						<p>3D Printing is the next level of innovation, which is set apart to bridge the gap between different fields of education. This is not a paper printing technology, but a technique to print out ideas and designs into models. One of the greatest inventions of the 21st century is a must in training for all the departments of engineering, architecture, medical, arts etc. marking its entry into the domestic lifestyle. Some bold features and benefits of the workshop are:<br/><br/></p>
						<p>
						<b>==></b> Being a 100% practical training cum workshop, each participant will be able to print out his design into models, which will be given away as souvenirs at the end.<br/><br/>
						<b>==></b> The training includes both on software and hardware parts.<br/><br/>
						<b>==></b> Career orientation in the 3D Printing World for the participants.<br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p>Being a part of this workshop provides you the power to explore the hidden ideas, will give you the wings to ride the new era of innovations marked by technological evolution and sustainability. The idea is simply to bring out your innovation from paper to reality. Every era is marked by the presence of a new technology which boosts up the life style of the people. 1990s brought mobile technology in the market, 2000 saw the Internet boom and this era will be marked by the 3D Printing Technology, which will be hard to be replaced!!
						Donâ€™t miss the opportunity to be a part of the next generation, which is all set to stage for the first time in Gujarat.</p><br/>
						<p style="font-weight: bold;">Participants are required to bring Laptop and Mouse

						<h3>Auto Extravaganza</h3>
						<p>The early history of the automobile can be divided into a number of eras, based on the prevalent means of propulsion. Later periods were defined by trends in exterior styling, size, and utility preferences. In 1769 the first steam powered auto-mobile capable of human transportation was built by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. In 1807, FranÃ§ois Isaac de Rivaz designed the first car powered by an internal combustion engine fuelled by hydrogen. In 1886 the first petrol or gasoline powered auto-mobile the Benz Patent-Motorwagen was invented by Karl Benz. At the turn of the 20th century electrically powered auto-mobiles appeared but only occupied a niche market until the turn of the 21st century.</p>
						<p>It is an automobile workshop in which a car will be shown in the dismantled form and the working & necessity of every major component of a car and its innovations in it will be explained.</p>

						<h3>Designer's Haven</h3>
						<p>Design philosophies are fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a designer approaches his/her practice. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design. The boundaries between art and design are blurred, largely due to a range of applications both for the term 'art' and the term 'design'.</p>
						<p>This workshop here will make you learn and go through the complete designing process and will help you decide which one of Photoshop, Corel Draw and Maya, should you use according to the needs, requirements and applications, so that you use them efficiently.</p>

						<img src="images/133.jpg" />
						<h4>Google CardBoard</h4>
						<p>Google Cardboard is a fold-out cardboard smartphone mount that, when combined with lenses, a magnet, a piece of hook-and-loop fastener and a rubber band and held against the face, affords a virtual reality experience. A smartphone with stereoscopic display software fits into this device and the lenses allow a person to perceive the images as one single three-dimensional image. The headset is designed by Google, but there is no official manufacturer or vendor for the device. Instead, Google has the list of parts, schematics, and assembly instructions freely available on their website, recommending people assemble one themselves from readily available parts.</p>
						<p>This Workshop is to have an hands-on experiment on this wonder.</p>
