						<h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
						<p>Cloud computing is a recently evolved computing terminology or metaphor based on utility and consumption of computing resources. Cloud computing involves deploying groups of remote servers and software networked that allow centralized data storage and online access to computer services or resources. Clouds can be classified as public, private or hybrid.</p>
						<p>The criticisms about it are mainly focused on its social implications. This happens when the owner of the remote servers is a person or organization other than the user, as their interests may point in different directions, for example, the user may wish that his or her information is kept private, but the owner of the remote servers may want to take advantage of it for their own business.</p>

						<h3>Internet of Things</h3>
						<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is the interconnection of uniquely identifiable embedded computing devices within the existing Internet infrastructure. Typically, IoT is expected to offer advanced connectivity of devices, systems, and services that goes beyond machine-to-machine communications (M2M) and covers a variety of protocols, domains, and applications. The interconnection of these embedded devices (including smart objects), is expected to usher in automation in nearly all fields, while also enabling advanced applications like a Smart Grid.<br/><br/><a href="IoT.pdf" target="_blank">Click Here For SessionWise Detail...</a></p>

						<h3>QuadCopter</h3>
						<p>A quadcopter, also called a quadrotor helicopter, quadrotor, is a multirotor helicopter that is lifted and propelled by four rotors. Quadcopters are classified as rotorcraft, as opposed to fixed-wing aircraft, because their lift is generated by a set of rotors (vertically oriented propellers).</p>
						<p>Workshop is Organised by RoboTryst-2015, which is a National Robotics Championship and Workshop series Jointed by TRYST-2015 IIT-Delhi and Robosapiens Technologies Pvt. Ltd., will also be organising this year Prelims Rounds of RoboTryst-2015 at Selective Zonal Centers (Nirma University) all across the India.

						<h3>Auto Extravaganza</h3>
						<p>The early history of the automobile can be divided into a number of eras, based on the prevalent means of propulsion. Later periods were defined by trends in exterior styling, size, and utility preferences. In 1769 the first steam powered auto-mobile capable of human transportation was built by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. In 1807, François Isaac de Rivaz designed the first car powered by an internal combustion engine fuelled by hydrogen. In 1886 the first petrol or gasoline powered auto-mobile the Benz Patent-Motorwagen was invented by Karl Benz. At the turn of the 20th century electrically powered auto-mobiles appeared but only occupied a niche market until the turn of the 21st century.</p>
						<p>It is an automobile workshop in which a car will be shown in the dismantled form and the working & necessity of every major component of a car and its innovations in it will be explained.</p>

						<h3>Designer's Haven</h3>
						<p>Design philosophies are fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a designer approaches his/her practice. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design. The boundaries between art and design are blurred, largely due to a range of applications both for the term 'art' and the term 'design'.</p>
						<p>This workshop here will make you learn and go through the complete designing process and will help you decide which one of Photoshop, Corel Draw and Maya, should you use according to the needs, requirements and applications, so that you use them efficiently.</p>

						<h4>Google CardBoard</h4>
						<p>Google Cardboard is a fold-out cardboard smartphone mount that, when combined with lenses, a magnet, a piece of hook-and-loop fastener and a rubber band and held against the face, affords a virtual reality experience. A smartphone with stereoscopic display software fits into this device and the lenses allow a person to perceive the images as one single three-dimensional image. The headset is designed by Google, but there is no official manufacturer or vendor for the device. Instead, Google has the list of parts, schematics, and assembly instructions freely available on their website, recommending people assemble one themselves from readily available parts.</p>
						<p>This Workshop is to have an hands-on experiment on this wonder.</p>
